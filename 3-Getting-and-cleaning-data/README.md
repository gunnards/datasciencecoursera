run_analysis.R combines the data refered to in CodeBook.md into one dataframe and exports a tidy table called tidy.txt.

Only features representing mean and standard deviation from the original dataset are used in this project.

Acitivty lables replace the activity IDs of Y_train and Y_test.

Tidy.txt calculates the mean values of all mean and std values.
